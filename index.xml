        <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;about&#34;&gt;About:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I always write for my audience, not for myself, so this feels indulgent. When I think of expressing this kind of “about me” stuff in an article, I stop myself because it’s not directly useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	So this is just one big page where I can write all about myself, without feeling the need for it to be &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/useless&#34;&gt;useful&lt;/a&gt;. And some day this site will be all that’s left of me, so I might as well write my own mini autobiography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;​	2019: moved to Oxford, England&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About me:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-ambitiously-focused-on-creating&#34;&gt;I’m ambitiously focused on creating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;More than anything, I want to make lots of stuff.&lt;/strong&gt; 	I want to make articles, books, websites, music, companies, systems, apps, and especially new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	This shapes most of my life decisions. Saying no to almost everything, so I can have lots of time for making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	At the age of 14, I decided I wanted to be a successful musician. Knowing it’s something that millions want, but only one-in-a-million  achieve, I knew I’d have to be fiercely focused, persistent, savvy, and  work like an Olympic athlete in training. In other words, not casual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I was single-focused obsessed with being a successful musician from age 14 to 29 — crucial years when many of my friends were feeling lost. It had me waking up early to practice, staying up late to write, saying no to all distractions, and reading whatever I could to improve. Then, at age 29, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/a&#34;&gt;accidentally started a company&lt;/a&gt;, so I was narrow-focused on creating that for 10 years, through the age of 39.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I also want to &lt;strong&gt;learn&lt;/strong&gt; lots of stuff, especially different approaches to thinking and living. That’s why I read so much non-fiction, and want to keep moving around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I connect with those who stretch, strive, and grow. I can’t relate to those who chill, hang out, watch TV, party, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;I’ve optimized my life for creating and learning.&lt;/strong&gt; 	I’ve cut out most things from my life that most normal people do —  (like hanging out or media consumption) — in pursuit of my bigger goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-life-philosophy&#34;&gt;My life philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I’ve always had an uncommon approach to life, mostly shaped by my ambition. But when I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/book/StoicJoy&#34;&gt;a book on Stoicism&lt;/a&gt; I realized I wasn’t so unique. My own self-created philosophy lined up almost exactly with this ancient philosophy. So, if you want to know my approach to life, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/book/StoicJoy&#34;&gt;go read these book notes&lt;/a&gt;. Especially the biggest point about strengthening yourself for a more difficult future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	But I’m also very skeptical, and was surprised to find &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism&#34;&gt;that’s also a philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. Meaning: &lt;strong&gt;for almost anything on this page, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/opposite&#34;&gt;opposite may also be true&lt;/a&gt;.  I don’t trust what I tell myself.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not a lie — it’s my truth at the time. But an opposite point of view can replace it when I shift my perspective. (I sometimes do this intentionally: do the opposite of my beliefs, just for a different perspective.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-dont-work-for-money&#34;&gt;I don’t work for money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Some might say I’m retired, because I haven’t earned (hardly) any money since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	And in some sense it’s true: I don’t want any more money than I’ve already got. And I don’t want more fame, recognition, or anything external.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	So in that sense, I’m done. Retired. No longer working for money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Now my ambitions are entirely intrinsic and intellectual. I work as hard as ever, but just for my own learning, creating, and giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-love-to-work-alone-12-hours-a-day&#34;&gt;I love to work alone 12 hours a day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I use the term “work”, because it’s more understood, but really it’s “me time” — doing what I love. 	&lt;strong&gt;Writing, learning, improving, and creating.&lt;/strong&gt; 	Whether it’s creating music, websites, books, or companies, it’s all just creating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	The word “workaholic” would apply, except it’s play, not work. It’s completely intrinsic — just following my own interests. I’ve found what I love, and do it as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I prefer this as a solo pursuit. Being around other people drains me, and I don’t want to compromise this side of my life. It’s a very personal pursuit. It’s not business — it’s more like art. The rewards are internal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Nobody gives a novelist shit for writing alone. But an entrepreneur, programmer, or musician is expected to collaborate. I disagree, for me. I prefer the life of a novelist, whether I’m writing code, music, or systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	12 hours a day works best for me, about 6 days a week. It’s good to break the gravity one day a week, and force myself to do something else. I resist it at first, but appreciate it afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Besides my “work”, I write in my journal up to three hours a day. Reflecting, daydreaming, planning. Asking myself questions, and trying different answers. It feels like all my learning happens here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-american&#34;&gt;I’m American&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I didn’t realize, until I left America at age 40, that in the big spectrum of cultural norms, I’m very stereotypical American. Well, west-coast American. Meaning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	very individualist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	live-to-work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	nomadic with weak family ties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	averse to traditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	my meals usually last just a few minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	quick to open up emotionally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	seeking new ideas and people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	always smiling and finding the bright side ☺&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-an-expat--world-citizen&#34;&gt;I’m an expat / world citizen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	The first six years of my life, we moved to a new distant place every year. (It was for my dad’s work.) This felt normal to me, so I remember how sad it was when it stopped. When I was six, we moved to Chicago, and I asked my mom how long we would stay. She said, “Maybe 5-10 years. Maybe the rest of your life.” I started sobbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	That was the saddest thought to me: to stop moving. Still is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I bounced around America for my first 40 years, moving every year or two. Berkeley, Chicago, Boston, New York, Woodstock, Portland, Santa Monica, San Francisco. Then I realized I was like a fly in a jar. It was time to open the lid, and explore the rest of the world. I had spent the first 40 years of my life in America, so I wanted to spend the next 40 out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	My original mission was to live all around the world, everywhere for 6-12 months each, for the next 40 years. I wanted to get embedded into each place until it felt like home, then move and do it again. But as soon as it began, I had a kid with someone who didn’t like that plan, so plans changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Instead, I’ve been spending a few years in places — becoming a legal  resident or citizen of Singapore, India, Belgium, New Zealand, England,  and Portugal. Each one feels like home, in a way. I’d love to slowly expand my sense of home until it covers the corners  of all continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	My kid feels this is normal, as I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	All that said, no place has got as deeply into my soul as New Zealand did. That’s my real or ultimate home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-prefer-talking-on-the-phone-to-hanging-in-person&#34;&gt;I prefer talking on the phone to hanging in person&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I might sound like a total recluse by now, but I’m not. Most people who meet me think I’m a total extrovert, because I’m a real conversationalist, and absolutely love talking one-on-one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	But I have a social window of about 2-3 hours. After that I’m drained, and want to be alone again. Because of this, I’m not into hanging out all day or night, just passing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Phone calls seem to be more focused. More ideas per hour. A better use of time. You’re undistracted by surroundings, and focus on the quality of the conversation. And when the conversation dwindles, you say goodbye and talk again another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Also, I love voices. Some people need to look into someone’s eyes to know them well. Not me. For me, it’s all about the voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Two of my best friends right now, I’ve never seen in-person. One lives in Hong Kong. One lives in Lithuania. We’ve been talking on the phone for years, but never met in-person. We don’t even video-chat. Just voice. That’s all I need. (Because of this, I loved the movie “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz&#34;&gt;Her&lt;/a&gt;”.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	As usual, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/pa&#34;&gt;my kid&lt;/a&gt; is the exception to this rule. He and I hang out about 30 hours a week, and will putter in one place for six hours at a time. But that’s a different thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-a-minimalist&#34;&gt;I’m a minimalist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I hate waste. I don’t like the feeling of having more than I need. It feels like clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Yes this means I only own one pair of pants, have only two plates in my little apartment, and my computer is a 7-year-old clunky laptop that  works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	But it also applies to tech: removing every line of website code that  isn’t necessary, and hand-writing a site with no framework or libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	And it applies to my writing: spending 12 hours writing an article,  saying everything on my mind, then editing it down to the few words that are really needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-tech-independent&#34;&gt;I’m tech-independent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I got online in 1994, so I watched many companies — companies that  people were completely dependent on — go out of business, and watched  everyone’s uploaded stuff just disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	So I don’t trust companies, I avoid the cloud, and run everything myself on my own server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I don’t depend on tech that’s not truly open source and non-profit,  because otherwise I don’t trust that their long-term incentives are  aligned with mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	My main tools are the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/post/&#34;&gt;http://www.964813.xyz/post/&lt;/a&gt; text editor, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/post/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; operating system, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/pg&#34;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; database, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/post/&#34;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; language, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I don’t use any apps on my phone, for this same reason. I don’t want to depend on apps for productivity. Actually I tend to avoid my phone, in general. I just use it for calling friends, or for GPS. No email. No social media. It sits in airplane mode much of the time, then I completely power it  off an hour before bed, and turn it back on after I’m done writing in  the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	All of my current creative and learning goals can be achieved with  these existing tools, so I avoid that time-sinking habit of looking for  new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-not-into-family&#34;&gt;I’m not into family&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Man, I catch a lot of shit for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I don’t hate but don’t love my family. They’re fine. I just never felt that close to them, even as a little kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I don’t subscribe to that “blood is thicker than water” metaphor. I feel pretty equally connected to everyone. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/01/your-family-past-present-and-future.html&#34;&gt;We’re all cousins&lt;/a&gt;, anyway.) I don’t feel more bound or obligated to my immediate family than I do to strangers. In fact, because of my ambitious exploring nature, I’d rather focus on the unknown, and push further out into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	All of my relatives, every single one of them, live basically right next to each other in Portland Oregon. I’m the black sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I make friends easily. They come and go based on life circumstances. Proximity and interests spark friendships, but proximity and interests change. Best friends become old distant friends. New friends become best friends. Some people get married and stop calling. Some people get divorced and re-appear. I still &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/friends&#34;&gt;love them all&lt;/a&gt;, whether we talk or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I’m &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/pa&#34;&gt;very attached to my kid&lt;/a&gt;, but I don’t expect him to be attached to me. I don’t want him to feel more tied to some people than others. I hope he ventures out into the world, makes new bonds, and feels no obligation to me. He doesn’t owe me anything. His life is his own. He didn’t ask to be born, and has no debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I don’t like live music. (I know that is a very despicable opinion.) I love great recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Like my preference for one-on-one conversations, my relationship to a  piece of music is personal — it’s between me and the music. I don’t want to have a bunch of other people around, and don’t want to  be distracted with other things when listening. Ideally, instead of a one-to-one relationship between listener and  musician, it would be one-to-zero, where I can’t even know who the  musician is. Then I could focus just on the music itself, and not be distracted by  any personal information about the musician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Most of my interest in music has been as a music-maker. I’m fluent in that language. I graduated from Berklee College of Music. I know almost too much music theory. I ran a recording studio for 12 years, and produced and engineered  hundreds of recordings, often playing all the instruments myself. When listening to a piece of music, I’m usually too analytical.  If you play something for me and ask, “What do you think?”, I’m almost  always thinking about what I would have done differently if I had  written it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I’m not bragging about this. It kinda sucks. It makes me incompatible with most music situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;So what *do* I like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;Innovative arrangements.&lt;/strong&gt; 	I love a unique combination and intersection of instruments. New sounds I’ve never heard before. It’s hard to listen to yet another guitar-bass-drums rock band. I need more creativity than that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;Song craft.&lt;/strong&gt; 	I admire it like a carpenter admires a well-made table. I worked hard for &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/music&#34;&gt;15 years&lt;/a&gt; to write the best songs I could, trying to learn everything about that craft, and so appreciate a good one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;Great recordings,&lt;/strong&gt; 	for the same reason. After years recording music, I so appreciate something well-produced and well-engineered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;New ideas.&lt;/strong&gt; 	I’m unimpressed by emoting, because emotions are not impressive. I’ve heard all the regular wailing with the same-old palette of sounds and words. I have to be hit with a new idea, a new angle, to be interested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-about-me&#34;&gt;More about me:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;I single-task.&lt;/strong&gt; 	I’m into only one thing at a time, focusing on it to completion, whether that takes hours, months, or even years. I’ve always been like this, even as a little kid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;I think very long-term and future-focused.&lt;/strong&gt; 	Even as a teenager, when friends would tease me for not having tattoos  or piercings, I never got them because my first thought is, “Will I want that when I’m 80?” If not, then why do it? My present life is in service of my future self. I tend to do things for my future, not my present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;I like women.&lt;/strong&gt; 	Almost all of my best friends are women. &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/mw&#34;&gt;Gender stereotypes&lt;/a&gt; bristle me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;I’m wary of anything that feels like addiction.&lt;/strong&gt; 	Whether drinking, phone/internet use, playing games, or whatever — if  people tend to get an unhealthy addiction to it, I avoid it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;I care deeply about very little.&lt;/strong&gt; 	I’m committed to just a few people and a few interests. Everything else, I keep away. (See “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/hellyeah&#34;&gt;hell yeah or no&lt;/a&gt;”.) It’s a simple and sincere life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;I walk away — to a fault.&lt;/strong&gt; 	I’m not a fighter. When something’s not to my liking — or if something gets too confrontational or antagonistic — I just leave. Since I’m happy being alone, the bar is set really high to make me engage with a person or situation that I’m not enjoying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;I’m deliberate.&lt;/strong&gt; 	I don’t believe in the “I can’t help the way I am” approach to life. Only dead fish go with the flow. I change who I am to get what I want, instead of the other way around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;I hate noise.&lt;/strong&gt; 	I’m always seeking silence. I don’t like crowds, cities, bars, parties, streets, etc. I damaged my hearing at a concert when I was 13, with a loud ringing  ever since, so I don’t know if it’s due to that or not, but in a crowd I can’t pick out one voice from another. So meeting people in noisy places is pointless, since I can’t  understand what anyone is saying. It’s another reason I prefer quiet one-on-one conversations. I even go to the gym late at night, after they close, so I can work out in silence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;I hate to waste a single hour.&lt;/strong&gt; 	I feel the precious value of time, most of the time. I imagine my time as worth $500 an hour, and ask myself what’s worth $500. Watching a TV show?  Absolutely not. (“Game of Thrones” at 63 hours so far = $31,500 to watch.) Social media?  Absolutely not. Focused learning or creating?  Yep! Being with my kid?  Always.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions-thoughts&#34;&gt;Questions? Thoughts?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	No comments here. That would be too weird. This is too personal. Just &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/contact&#34;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://www.964813.xyz/contact/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;contact-lmg_bit163com&#34;&gt;Contact &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:lmg_bit@163.com&#34;&gt;lmg_bit@163.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I love hearing from people, so please email me at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:lmg_bit@163.com&#34;&gt;lmg_bit@163.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;introduce yourself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Why? For two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	I love getting to know people around the world. (Many of my best friends and even great loves are people who I met when they emailed to introduce themselves.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	Because I know a lot of people, I can help &lt;strong&gt;connect&lt;/strong&gt; you with someone you should meet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Yes it’s really me, and &lt;strong&gt;I reply to all&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;caveat-read-first&#34;&gt;Caveat (read first)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	First &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/faq&#34;&gt;please read my “frequently asked questions” page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	If that page didn’t answer your question, please search my site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I’m not doing any public speaking or interviews now, but might soon, so introduce yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/nopr&#34;&gt; 	I don’t promote. &lt;/a&gt; I don’t invest. And &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/no2&#34;&gt; 	I’m not taking on any new projects. &lt;/a&gt; But I love to be aware of what you’re doing, even though I can’t get involved or answer questions about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	So really the main reason to contact me is to &lt;strong&gt;introduce yourself&lt;/strong&gt;, which I hope you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-or-just-follow&#34;&gt;… or just follow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	You can follow me using  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/index.xml&#34;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;I don’t check my social media inboxes.&lt;/strong&gt; 	So please just email me instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Now</title>
      <link>http://www.964813.xyz/post/now/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2020 13:16:48 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.964813.xyz/post/now/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-im-doing-now&#34;&gt;What I’m doing now&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;focusing&#34;&gt;Focusing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s the meta-answer. There are times in my life when my head is up, looking around. And times when my head is down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m completely head-down and focused. Not even reading. Just programming and writing every hour I’m awake. All work. No play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except when I’m with my son. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/dw&#34;&gt;stop everything&lt;/a&gt; then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;programming&#34;&gt;Programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 10+ years I’ve been making web apps using only Ruby on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I need to make a few new web apps, and update my old web apps,  so I thought it was time to look into a new way of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking into every existing framework and toolkit, I’ve decided to use plain modern JavaScript, no frameworks. So now I’m programming my translation site and storefront to sell my books. It feels nice to start from scratch, and remind myself of the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the real work is done in &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/pg&#34;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finishing-how-to-livehttpssiversorgh&#34;&gt;Finishing “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/h&#34;&gt;How to Live&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many hours a day, finishing the book I’ve been most excited about for the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s coming together really well. I think it’s by far the best thing I’ve ever done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more about that, later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;weightlifting-55&#34;&gt;Weightlifting, 5×5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days a week, hit the gym for 45 minutes to do the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/is-stronglifts-5x5-the-right-training-program-for-you.html&#34;&gt;5×5 routine&lt;/a&gt;.  Current 5×5 weights as of today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;squat&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;120 kg&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;overhead&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50 kg&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;row&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;55 kg&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;bench&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;77.5 kg&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;deadlift&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;120 kg&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;book-not-articles&#34;&gt;Book, not articles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, I’ve shared all of my ideas in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz&#34;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/1idea&#34;&gt;One idea at a time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m trying something different this time. I’m saving them, and putting them all in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 10 times a day, as I’m writing, I think of an idea that would make a good stand-alone article. But instead of stopping to blog, I keep working on the book. Gotta finish. Gotta finish.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Frequently Asked Question</title>
      <link>http://www.964813.xyz/faq/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 13:16:48 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.964813.xyz/faq/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;​	In the last ten years, I have answered over 200,000 emails from 86,000 people. It’s my part-time job — my community service. These are the most common questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-should-i-do-about-my-career&#34;&gt;What should I do about my career?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Read the book “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/career&#34;&gt;So Good They Can’t Ignore You&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-should-i-do-with-my-life&#34;&gt;What should I do with my life?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Read “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/hsu&#34;&gt;Happy, Smart, and Useful&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;can-you-introduce-me-to-famous-person&#34;&gt;Can you introduce me to (famous person)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	No, sorry. Definitely not on request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	If my friends &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; me if I know someone who’s doing what you’re doing, or have a specific need, then I’ll be glad to recommend you. But not if they don’t ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;will-you-promote-my-thing&#34;&gt;Will you promote my thing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Read “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/nopr&#34;&gt;Why I don’t promote&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;will-you-invest-in-my-company&#34;&gt;Will you invest in my company?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	No, sorry. I never had investors. I have never invested in anyone or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I don’t know anything about investing, and I’m not interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;can-i-use-your-video--article&#34;&gt;Can I use your video / article?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;Yes. Anything I put on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/&#34;&gt;www.964813.xyz&lt;/a&gt; is free forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	It would be nice if you could credit me and link back to sivers.org But honestly I don’t care either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	For the “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/ff&#34;&gt;First Follower — How to Make a Movement — Leadership Lessons from a Dancing Guy&lt;/a&gt;” dancing guy video, please get my original from &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/ff&#34;&gt;sivers.org/ff&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/post/&#34;&gt;the one from the TED Conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;will-you-be-on-my-podcast&#34;&gt;Will you be on my podcast?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;Maybe. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/post/contact&#34;&gt;Email me&lt;/a&gt; a list of questions you’d like to ask.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I enjoy interviews when the questions are interesting, and haven’t been covered before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/post/&#34;&gt;Here is the archive&lt;/a&gt; of my past podcast interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;will-you-speak-at-my-event&#34;&gt;Will you speak at my event?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Sorry, I don’t do public speaking anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ive-got-content-for-your-site&#34;&gt;I’ve got content for your site.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	No, this is my personal site, completely non-commercial, for my personal expression only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	No advertising, no income, no analytics, no tracking, nobody else’s stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-cant-focus&#34;&gt;I can’t focus.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	First understand the do-or-die importance of focus. 	&lt;strong&gt;If you don’t learn to focus, you will have a shallow and unrewarding life without any meaningful achievements.&lt;/strong&gt; 	So make it a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Read the book “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/book/DeepWork&#34;&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Read “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/donkey&#34;&gt;Trying to pursue many different directions at once?&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Practice meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Yes it’s hard. Websites, phone apps, and media in general are designed to be as addictive as possible. Treat them as you would other harmful addictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-have-a-boring-well-paying-job-should-i-quit-my-job-to-pursue-my-art-full-time&#34;&gt;I have a boring well-paying job. Should I quit my job to pursue my art full-time?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Read “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/balance&#34;&gt;How to do what you love and make good money&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;im-a-full-time-artist-but-cant-make-money-what-should-i-do&#34;&gt;I’m a full-time artist, but can’t make money. What should I do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Read “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/balance&#34;&gt;How to do what you love and make good money&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-do-you-think-of-this-business-idea&#34;&gt;What do you think of this business idea?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;It doesn’t matter what anyone thinks, except your customers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Nobody can predict whether it will work or not. So stop asking “in-theory” and go find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Find just one paying customer, and please that person. &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/startnow&#34;&gt; 	Start lo-fi, right now. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Read “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/book/LeanStartup&#34;&gt;The Lean Startup&lt;/a&gt;” book, for more thoughts on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-can-i-find-a-mentor&#34;&gt;Where can I find a mentor?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	First read “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/ment&#34;&gt;How to ask your mentors for help&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Then read “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/advice&#34;&gt;A warning to anyone receiving advice&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Then read the best books about the challenges you face, and &lt;strong&gt;let those books be your mentors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;It’s dangerous to think that there is one special person that can give you all the answers and help you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Talk with many people, not just experts. &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/book/WisdomOfCrowds&#34;&gt; 	Get a diverse group of opinions. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I never had a mentor. When stuck on a problem, I’ve always called many friends for feedback. Some of the best and most helpful insights came from random friends asking naïve questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-isnt-my-business-or-audience-growing-faster&#34;&gt;Why isn’t my business or audience growing faster?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I worked on CD Baby for 12-18 hours per day, 7 days per week, for &lt;strong&gt;four years&lt;/strong&gt; before it really took off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	As for an audience, I’ve been creating and posting things online for free non-stop since 1994. Yep, that’s &lt;strong&gt;25 years&lt;/strong&gt; now. And &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/hundreds&#34;&gt;keeping in touch&lt;/a&gt; with everyone I met that whole time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Keep pushing, but be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-should-i-learn-programming&#34;&gt;How should I learn programming?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	First master HTML and CSS, as described in “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/prog&#34;&gt;Should you learn programming? Yes.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;Then learn JavaScript, as described in “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/learn-js&#34;&gt;How to learn JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	If you just want to get a job or make a website, you can ignore the curiosity about other languages. Just master JavaScript, and it will take you far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	But if you still find programming fascinating, make a point of learning the basics of three or four other vastly different languages, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-sql/9780596526849/&#34;&gt;SQL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/post/&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://racket-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt;, because something clicks once you understand a few different ways of getting the end result you want. You don’t need to master them. Just spend a month with each, going through a couple tutorial books about it, and making something happen with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Definitely read “&lt;a href=&#34;https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer&#34;&gt;The Pragmatic Programmer&lt;/a&gt;”, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-do-i-become-a-better-writer&#34;&gt;How do I become a better writer?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	First read “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/book/OnWritingWell&#34;&gt;On Writing Well&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Then read “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/book/MadeToStick&#34;&gt;Made to Stick&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Write publicly every week. Post it somewhere people see it. Something changes when your writing is out in the public, being seen by strangers. Seeing it through their eyes helps more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;will-you-read-or-review-my-book&#34;&gt;Will you read or review my book?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I don’t review books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I only read for my own self-improvement, based on my own needs at the time, then &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/book&#34;&gt;take notes&lt;/a&gt; for my own reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;im-a-musician-what-should-i-do&#34;&gt;I’m a musician. What should I do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Read “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1631494791/&#34;&gt;How To Make It in the New Music Business&lt;/a&gt;” by Ari Herstand, and do what he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;This is the single best book on the current music business. An absolute must-read for every musician.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

      <title>How to change or build your career</title>
      <link>http://www.964813.xyz/post/career/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 13:16:48 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.964813.xyz/post/career/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I get emails from many people wanting to change or build their career. I always recommend the best book on the subject: “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/book/SoGood&#34;&gt;So Good They Can’t Ignore You&lt;/a&gt;” by Cal Newport. Here are a few of its best points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;forget-passion-and-purpose&#34;&gt;Forget passion and purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Forget “follow your passion” or “find your true calling”. Stop thinking like that. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Words like “passion” and “purpose” are dangerous because they sound huge and romantic. If you think you haven’t found your passion yet, you’re probably &lt;strong&gt;expecting it to be overwhelming&lt;/strong&gt; — to hit you like lightning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Looking for your passion, purpose, or calling is an example of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/mindset&#34;&gt;fixed mindset&lt;/a&gt;. You’re assuming that this is an inherent and unchanging thing inside of you, like trying to read your DNA or blood type. But you won’t find passion and purpose there, because &lt;strong&gt;that’s not where those feelings come from.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Passion and purpose are &lt;strong&gt;emotions that come after expertise and experience.&lt;/strong&gt; The way to get them is to commit to &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/book/Mastery&#34;&gt;the path of mastery&lt;/a&gt;, get great at something, and do great work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	So instead of looking for passion and purpose, just keep mastering  whatever work you’ve started, becoming more and more valuable in your  field. Passion and purpose will follow a great career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;great-careers-are-only-for-the-rare-and-valuable&#34;&gt;Great careers are only for the rare and valuable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Think of what makes a great career:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	good pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	room to grow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	freedom and control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	positive impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​	emotionally rewarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Jobs like this are rare and valuable. A great career isn’t something you &lt;strong&gt;find&lt;/strong&gt; — it’s something you &lt;strong&gt;earn&lt;/strong&gt; when you’ve got &lt;strong&gt;rare and valuable skills to offer in return.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	In other words, you can only earn a great career by building your expertise and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;solution-focus-on-the-craft-not-passion&#34;&gt;Solution: focus on the craft, not passion.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	The solution to this problem is what’s called “the craftman’s path” — the long-term path to mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Everyone who became great at something has a similar story: For years, they worked on their craft every day, even if they weren’t in the mood. Always pushing, practicing, working, and improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	It doesn’t matter if you’re feeling passionate about it that day or even that month. You keep working and keep improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	It doesn’t matter whether your work environment is ideal or you’re being wonderfully rewarded yet. You keep working and keep improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Yes it takes thousands of hours of practice, but that’s good news! &lt;strong&gt;It’s a clear path and it’s under your control&lt;/strong&gt;, instead of dwelling on unanswerable questions like “What is my true calling?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	You forget the self-centered concerns about your passion and purpose,  and instead just keep improving and getting really damn good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	It doesn’t matter if your current job isn’t perfect. &lt;strong&gt;You just keep improving&lt;/strong&gt;, no matter where you are, &lt;strong&gt;becoming more and more valuable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	By building your skills, experience, and value, you earn a great career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	By building your skills, experience, and value, &lt;strong&gt;passion and purpose come to you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	By building your skills, experience, and value, you are building your “career capital”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;career-capital-use-it-to-make-a-change&#34;&gt;Career capital: use it to make a change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	“Career capital” is a metaphor. Think of it like gold tokens you’re earning over years of building your expertise, experience, connections, and reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	The important point is to &lt;strong&gt;remember how valuable it is&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	When you want to make a change to your career, you spend this career capital you’ve earned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	But if you’re really sick of your current field and want to switch to another field, &lt;strong&gt;don’t just quit and throw away all the career capital you’ve built up!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	&lt;strong&gt;If you’re thinking of quitting your job to follow your passion, please don’t miss this point!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Think of ways you can &lt;strong&gt;use the value you’ve built up&lt;/strong&gt; to make the transition to another field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/tarzan&#34;&gt;Like Tarzan&lt;/a&gt;, use your connections, reputation, experience, and expertise to &lt;strong&gt;transition&lt;/strong&gt; into a better situation in the new field before leaving the old one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	Realize the career capital you’ve built up already, and don’t just throw it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;starting-from-scratch&#34;&gt;Starting from scratch?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	If you’re starting from scratch anyway, jump into any growing field and start building your skills, expertise, connections, and reputation. Pick a niche and dominate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	If you have no ideas, check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz&#34;&gt;this list of what startup investors want to invest in&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/&#34;&gt;JWT’s “Things to Watch”&lt;/a&gt; is always fun and inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;read-so-good-they-cant-ignore-youhttpssiversorgbooksogood&#34;&gt;Read “&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/book/SoGood&#34;&gt;So Good They Can’t Ignore You&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	The ideas here are just a little incomplete intro to an amazing book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	“&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/book/SoGood&#34;&gt;So Good They Can’t Ignore You&lt;/a&gt;” by &lt;a href=&#34;http://calnewport.com/&#34;&gt;Cal Newport&lt;/a&gt;, is the best I’ve ever read on the subject of building or changing your career. &lt;a href=&#34;https://commoncog.com/blog/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/&#34;&gt;Here is a great summary of it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	I just searched my email out-box and found out that I’ve personally  recommended it to people over a hundred times in the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​	If this subject interests you at all, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/book/SoGood&#34;&gt;get and read the full book&lt;/a&gt;, not just my summary.&lt;/p&gt;

\frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} \equiv 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\cdots} } } }

\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sum-of-a-series&#34;&gt;Sum of a Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I broke up the next two examples into separate lines so it behaves better on a mobile phone. That&amp;rsquo;s why they include \displaystyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}i
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\displaystyle= \left(\sum_{i=1}^{k}i\right) +(k+1)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\displaystyle= \frac{k(k+1)}{2}+k+1
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\displaystyle= \frac{k(k+1)+2(k+1)}{2}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\displaystyle= \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\displaystyle= \frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)}{2}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;product-notation&#34;&gt;Product notation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\displaystyle 1 + \frac{q^2}{(1-q)}+\frac{q^6}{(1-q)(1-q^2)}+\cdots = \displaystyle \prod_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(1-q^{5j+2})(1-q^{5j+3})}, \displaystyle\text{ for }\lvert q\rvert &amp;lt; 1.
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cross-product&#34;&gt;Cross Product&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works in KaTeX, but the separation of fractions in this environment is not so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\mathbf{V}_1 \times \mathbf{V}_2 = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} &amp;amp; \mathbf{j} &amp;amp; \mathbf{k} \ \frac{\partial X}{\partial u} &amp;amp; \frac{\partial Y}{\partial u} &amp;amp; 0 \ \frac{\partial X}{\partial v} &amp;amp; \frac{\partial Y}{\partial v} &amp;amp; 0 \end{vmatrix}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a workaround: make the fractions smaller with an extra class that targets the spans with &amp;ldquo;mfrac&amp;rdquo; class (makes no difference in the MathJax case):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\mathbf{V}_1 \times \mathbf{V}_2 = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} &amp;amp; \mathbf{j} &amp;amp; \mathbf{k} \ \frac{\partial X}{\partial u} &amp;amp; \frac{\partial Y}{\partial u} &amp;amp; 0 \ \frac{\partial X}{\partial v} &amp;amp; \frac{\partial Y}{\partial v} &amp;amp; 0 \end{vmatrix}

$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These equations are quite cramped. We can add vertical spacing using (for example) [1em] after each line break (\). as you can see here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{aligned} \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -, \frac1c, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} &amp;amp; = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}} \[1em] \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} &amp;amp; = 4 \pi \rho \[0.5em] \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}, +, \frac1c, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} &amp;amp; = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \[1em] \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} &amp;amp; = 0 \end{aligned}

      <title>Shortcodes Preview</title>
      <link>http://www.964813.xyz/post/shortcodes-preview/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Mar 2018 16:01:23 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.964813.xyz/post/shortcodes-preview/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-a-shortcode-is&#34;&gt;What a Shortcode is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo loves Markdown because of its simple content format, but there are times when Markdown falls short. Often, content authors are forced to add raw HTML (e.g., video &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframes&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) to Markdown content. We think this contradicts the beautiful simplicity of Markdown&amp;rsquo;s syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo created &lt;strong&gt;shortcodes&lt;/strong&gt; to circumvent these limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shortcode is a simple snippet inside a content file that Hugo will render using a predefined template. Note that shortcodes will not work in template files. If you need the type of drop-in functionality that shortcodes provide but in a template, you most likely want a [partial template][/post/will] instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to cleaner Markdown, shortcodes can be updated any time to reflect new classes, techniques, or standards. At the point of site generation, Hugo shortcodes will easily merge in your changes. You avoid a possibly complicated search and replace operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/&#34;&gt;https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gist&#34;&gt;gist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can embed the gist in our content via username and gist ID pulled from the URL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;{{&amp;lt; gist spf13 7896402 &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Display:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/javascript&#34; src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/spf13/7896402.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;expand&#34;&gt;expand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Expand shortcode displays an expandable/collapsible section of text on your page. Here is an example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary style=&#34;background-color:#f5f5f5;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:5px;&#34;&gt;
    Is this learn theme rocks ?
    
  &lt;/summary&gt;
  
Yes !.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;usage&#34;&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this shortcode takes exactly one optional parameter to define the text that appears next to the expand/collapse icon. (default is “Click to expand”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;{{&amp;lt; expand &amp;#34;Is this learn theme rocks ?&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}}
Yes !.
{{&amp;lt; /expand &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;youku&#34;&gt;youku&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://player.youku.com/embed/XMzQ0ODUxMjM2NA?autoplay=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34; title=&#34;YouKu Video&#34;&gt;

      <link>http://www.964813.xyz/post/image-preview/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Mar 2018 16:01:23 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.964813.xyz/post/image-preview/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/post/&#34;&gt;liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/post/&#34;&gt;Zebradil · Pull Request #48&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we could use &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; gallery &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; shortcode in hugo-theme-jane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;normal-image&#34;&gt;Normal Image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an image in &lt;code&gt;static/image&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;![&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;This is an image in `static/image` folder.&lt;/span&gt;](&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;/image/example.jpg&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;-figure--shortcode&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; figure &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; shortcode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;figure-image-with-title&#34;&gt;figure image with title&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;{{&amp;lt; figure src=&amp;#34;/image/example.jpg&amp;#34; title=&amp;#34;figure image with title&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;figure-image-with-caption&#34;&gt;figure image with caption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;{{&amp;lt; figure src=&amp;#34;/image/example.jpg&amp;#34; caption=&amp;#34;figure image with caption figure image with caption figure image with caption figure image with caption figure image with caption&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;more--figure--shortcode-usage&#34;&gt;more &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; figure &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; shortcode usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifying your image files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; figure src=&amp;quot;thumb.jpg&amp;quot; link=&amp;quot;image.jpg&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; will use &lt;code&gt;thumb.jpg&lt;/code&gt; for thumbnail and &lt;code&gt;image.jpg&lt;/code&gt; for lightbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; figure src=&amp;quot;image.jpg&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; figure link=&amp;quot;image.jpg&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; will use &lt;code&gt;image.jpg&lt;/code&gt; for both thumbnail and lightbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; figure link=&amp;quot;image.jpg&amp;quot; thumb=&amp;quot;-small&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; will use &lt;code&gt;image-small.jpg&lt;/code&gt; for thumbnail and &lt;code&gt;image.jpg&lt;/code&gt; for lightbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optional parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/post/&#34;&gt;features/parameters&lt;/a&gt; of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s built-in &lt;code&gt;figure&lt;/code&gt; shortcode work as normal, i.e. src, link, title, caption, class, attr (attribution), attrlink, alt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. &lt;code&gt;size=&amp;quot;1024x768&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;) pre-defines the image size for PhotoSwipe. Use this option if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to pre-load the linked image to determine its size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; allows you to set any custom classes you want on the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optional parameters for standalone &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; figure &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; shortcodes only (i.e. don&amp;rsquo;t use on &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; figure &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; gallery &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; - strange things may happen if you do):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;caption-position&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;caption-effect&lt;/code&gt; work the same as for the &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; gallery &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; shortcode (see below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; defines the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/post/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;max-width&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the image displayed on the page. If using a thumbnail for a standalone figure, set this equal to your thumbnail&amp;rsquo;s native width to make the captions behave properly (or feel free to come up with a better solution and submit a pull request :-)). Also use this option if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a thumbnail and you don&amp;rsquo;t want the hi-res image to take up the entire width of the screen/container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;class=&amp;quot;no-photoswipe&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; prevents a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; from being loaded into PhotoSwipe. If you click on the figure you&amp;rsquo;ll instead a good ol&amp;rsquo; fashioned hyperlink to a bigger image (or - if you haven&amp;rsquo;t specified a bigger image - the same one).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-gallery--shortcode&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; gallery &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; shortcode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;simple-gallery&#34;&gt;simple gallery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To specify a directory of image files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;{{&amp;lt; gallery dir=&amp;#34;/img/your-directory-of-images/&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The images are automatically captioned with the file name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;[image].jpg&lt;/code&gt; is used for the hi-res image, and &lt;code&gt;[image]-thumb.jpg&lt;/code&gt; is used for the thumbnails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;[image]-thumb.jpg&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, then &lt;code&gt;[image].jpg&lt;/code&gt; will be used for both hi-res and thumbnail images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The default thumbnail suffix is &lt;code&gt;-thumb&lt;/code&gt;, but you can specify a different one e.g. &lt;code&gt;thumb=&amp;quot;-small&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;thumb=&amp;quot;_150x150&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;to-specify-individual-image-files&#34;&gt;To specify individual image files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;{{&amp;lt; gallery &amp;gt;}}
  {{&amp;lt; figure src=&amp;#34;image1.jpg&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}}
  {{&amp;lt; figure src=&amp;#34;image2.jpg&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}}
  {{&amp;lt; figure src=&amp;#34;image3.jpg&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}}
{{&amp;lt; /gallery &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional parameters:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;caption-position&lt;/code&gt; - determines the captions&amp;rsquo; position over the image. Options:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;bottom&lt;/code&gt; (default)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;center&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt; hides captions on the page (they will only show in PhotoSwipe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;caption-effect&lt;/code&gt; - determines if/how captions appear upon hover. Options:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;slide&lt;/code&gt; (default)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fade&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt; (captions always visible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hover-effect&lt;/code&gt; - determines if/how images change upon hover. Options:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;zoom&lt;/code&gt; (default)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;grow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;shrink&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;slideup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;slidedown&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hover-transition&lt;/code&gt; - determines if/how images change upon hover. Options:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not set - smooth transition (default)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt; - hard transition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 16:01:23 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.964813.xyz/post/jane-theme-preview/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markdown&lt;/strong&gt; is created by &lt;a href=&#34;http://daringfireball.net/&#34;&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, the original guideline is &lt;a href=&#34;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Its syntax, however, varies between different parsers or editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that HTML fragments in markdown source will be recognized but not parsed or rendered. Also, there may be small reformatting on the original markdown source code after saving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;paragraph-and-line-breaks&#34;&gt;Paragraph and line breaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text. In markdown source code, paragraphs are separated by more than one blank lines. In Typora, you only need to press &lt;code&gt;Return&lt;/code&gt; to create a new paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;Shift&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;Return&lt;/code&gt; to create a single line break. However, most markdown parser will ignore single line break, to make other markdown parsers recognize your line break, you can leave two whitespace at the end of the line, or insert &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headers&#34;&gt;Headers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headers use 1-6 hash characters at the start of the line, corresponding to header levels 1-6. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gh&#34;&gt;# This is an H1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gh&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;gu&#34;&gt;## This is an H2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gu&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;gu&#34;&gt;###### This is an H6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In typora, input ‘#’s followed by title content, and press &lt;code&gt;Return&lt;/code&gt; key will create a header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blockquotes&#34;&gt;Blockquotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown uses email-style &amp;gt; characters for block quoting. They are presented as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. This is first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is second pragraph.Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another blockquote with one paragraph. There is three empty line to seperate two blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是一段中文测试。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In typora, just input ‘&amp;gt;’ followed by quote contents a block quote is  generated. Typora will insert proper ‘&amp;gt;’ or line break for you. Block quote inside anther block quote is allowed by adding additional levels of ‘&amp;gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lists&#34;&gt;Lists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input &lt;code&gt;* list item 1&lt;/code&gt; will create an un-ordered list, the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; symbol can be replace with &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input &lt;code&gt;1. list item 1&lt;/code&gt; will create an ordered list, their markdown source code is like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-list&#34;&gt;Task List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Task lists are lists with items marked as either &lt;code&gt;[ ]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[x]&lt;/code&gt; (incomplete or complete). For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt;a task list item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt;list syntax required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt;normal &lt;strong&gt;formatting&lt;/strong&gt;, @mentions, #1234 refs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt;incomplete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt;completed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can change the complete/incomplete state by click the checkbox before the item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;syntax-highlighting&#34;&gt;Syntax Highlighting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;helloWorld&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Hello, World!&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Hello, World!&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;math-blocks&#34;&gt;Math Blocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can render &lt;em&gt;LaTeX&lt;/em&gt; mathematical expressions using &lt;strong&gt;MathJax&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input &lt;code&gt;$$&lt;/code&gt;, then press &amp;lsquo;Return&amp;rsquo; key will trigger an input field which accept &lt;em&gt;Tex/LaTex&lt;/em&gt; source. Following is an example:
$$
\mathbf{V}_1 \times \mathbf{V}_2 =  \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} &amp;amp; \mathbf{j} &amp;amp; \mathbf{k} \&lt;br&gt;
\frac{\partial X}{\partial u} &amp;amp;  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial u} &amp;amp; 0 \&lt;br&gt;
\frac{\partial X}{\partial v} &amp;amp;  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial v} &amp;amp; 0 \&lt;br&gt;
\end{vmatrix}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In markdown source file, math block is &lt;em&gt;LaTeX&lt;/em&gt; expression wrapped by ‘$$’ mark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;$$
\mathbf{V}_1 \times \mathbf{V}_2 =  \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} &amp;amp; \mathbf{j} &amp;amp; \mathbf{k} \\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial u} &amp;amp;  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial u} &amp;amp; 0 \\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial v} &amp;amp;  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial v} &amp;amp; 0 \\
\end{vmatrix}
$$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tables&#34;&gt;Tables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input &lt;code&gt;| First Header  | Second Header |&lt;/code&gt; and press &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; key will create a table with two column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After table is created, focus on that table will pop up a toolbar for table, where you can resize, align, or delete table. You can also use context menu to copy and add/delete column/row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following descriptions can be skipped, as markdown source code for tables are generated by typora automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In markdown source code, they look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7

&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;You can create footnotes like this[^footnote].

[^footnote]: Here is the &lt;span class=&#34;ge&#34;&gt;*text*&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class=&#34;gs&#34;&gt;**footnote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gs&#34;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;will produce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create footnotes like this&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mouse on the ‘footnote’ superscript to see content of the footnote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;horizontal-rules&#34;&gt;Horizontal Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input &lt;code&gt;***&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt; on a blank line and press &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; will draw a horizontal line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;links&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown supports two style of links: inline and reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text’s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses, put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an optional title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;This is [&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;an example&lt;/span&gt;](&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;http://www.964813.xyz/ &amp;#34;Title&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;) inline link.

[&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;This link&lt;/span&gt;](&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;http://www.964813.xyz/&lt;/span&gt;) has no title attribute.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;will produce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz%22Title%22&#34;&gt;an example&lt;/a&gt; inline link. (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.964813.xyz&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Title&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz&#34;&gt;This link&lt;/a&gt; has no title attribute. (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.964813.xyz&amp;quot;&amp;gt;This link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; has no&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;internal-links&#34;&gt;Internal Links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can set the href to headers&lt;/strong&gt;, which will create a bookmark that allow you to jump to that section after clicking. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Command(on Windows: Ctrl) + Click &lt;a href=&#34;#block-elements&#34;&gt;This link&lt;/a&gt; will jump to header &lt;code&gt;Block Elements&lt;/code&gt;. To see how to write that, please move cursor or click that link with &lt;code&gt;⌘&lt;/code&gt; key pressed to expand the element into markdown source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reference-links&#34;&gt;Reference Links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference-style links use a second set of square brackets, inside which you place a label of your choosing to identify the link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;This is [an example][id] reference-style link.

Then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this, on a line by itself:

[id]: http://example.com/  &amp;#34;Optional Title Here&amp;#34;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In typora, they will be rendered like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz&#34; title=&#34;Optional Title Here&#34;&gt;an example&lt;/a&gt; reference-style link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implicit link name shortcut allows you to omit the name of the link, in which case the link text itself is used as the name. Just use an empty set of square brackets — e.g., to link the word “Google” to the google.com web site, you could simply write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;[Google][]
And then define the link:

[Google]: http://google.com/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In typora click link will expand it for editing, command+click will open the hyperlink in web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;urls&#34;&gt;URLs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typora allows you to insert urls as links, wrapped by &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;brackets&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;i@typora.io&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:i@typora.io&#34;&gt;i@typora.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typora will aslo auto link standard URLs. e.g: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com&#34;&gt;www.google.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;images&#34;&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image looks similar with links, but it requires an additional &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; char before the start of link. Image syntax looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;![&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;Alt text&lt;/span&gt;](&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;/path/to/img.jpg&lt;/span&gt;)

![&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;Alt text&lt;/span&gt;](&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;/path/to/img.jpg &amp;#34;Optional title&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are able to use drag &amp;amp; drop to insert image from image file or we browser. And modify the markdown source code by clicking on the image. Relative path will be used if image is in same directory or sub-directory with current editing document when drag &amp;amp; drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more tips on images, please read &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.typora.io//Images/&#34;&gt;http://support.typora.io//Images/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emphasis&#34;&gt;Emphasis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown treats asterisks (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;) and underscores (&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;) as indicators of emphasis. Text wrapped with one &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; will be wrapped with an HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. E.g:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;*single asterisks*

&lt;span class=&#34;ge&#34;&gt;_single underscores_&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;single asterisks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;single underscores&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GFM will ignores underscores in words, which is commonly used in code and names, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wow_great_stuff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To produce a literal asterisk or underscore at a position where it would otherwise be used as an emphasis delimiter, you can backslash escape it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;\*this text is surrounded by literal asterisks\*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typora recommends to use &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strong&#34;&gt;Strong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;double *’s or _’s will be wrapped with an HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, e.g:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;**double asterisks**

&lt;span class=&#34;gs&#34;&gt;__double underscores&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gs&#34;&gt;__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;double asterisks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;double underscores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typora recommends to use &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;Use the &lt;span class=&#34;sb&#34;&gt;`printf()`&lt;/span&gt; function.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;will produce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;printf()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strikethrough&#34;&gt;Strikethrough&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GFM adds syntax to create strikethrough text, which is missing from standard Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~~Mistaken text.~~&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;del&gt;Mistaken text.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;Underline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underline is powered by raw HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;Underline&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Underline&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emoji-happy&#34;&gt;Emoji :happy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input emoji with syntax &lt;code&gt;😄&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User can trigger auto-complete suggestions for emoji by pressing &lt;code&gt;ESC&lt;/code&gt; key, or trigger it automatically after enable it on preference panel. Also, input UTF8 emoji char directly from &lt;code&gt;Edit&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Emoji &amp;amp; Symbols&lt;/code&gt; from menu bar is also supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;inline-math&#34;&gt;Inline Math&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use this feature, first, please enable it in &lt;code&gt;Preference&lt;/code&gt; Panel -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Markdown&lt;/code&gt; Tab. Then use &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; to wrap TeX command, for example: &lt;code&gt;$\lim_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0$&lt;/code&gt; will be rendered as LaTeX command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To trigger inline preview for inline math: input “$”, then press &lt;code&gt;ESC&lt;/code&gt; key, then input TeX command, a preview tooltip will be visible like below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;footnote&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the &amp;ldquo;$&amp;rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with &amp;ldquo;#&amp;rdquo; are comments that I&amp;rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the &amp;ldquo;:wq&amp;rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;23
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;## this is a comment
$ echo this is a command
this is a command

## edit the file
$vi foo.md
+++
date = &amp;#34;2014-09-28&amp;#34;
title = &amp;#34;creating a new theme&amp;#34;
+++

bah and humbug
:wq

## show it
$ cat foo.md
+++
date = &amp;#34;2014-09-28&amp;#34;
title = &amp;#34;creating a new theme&amp;#34;
+++

bah and humbug
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-definitions&#34;&gt;Some Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;skins&#34;&gt;Skins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the &lt;code&gt;layouts/&lt;/code&gt; directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the &lt;code&gt;layouts/&lt;/code&gt; directory so it will always find the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the &lt;code&gt;themes/&lt;/code&gt; directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between creating a skin in &lt;code&gt;layouts/&lt;/code&gt; and creating it in &lt;code&gt;themes/&lt;/code&gt; is very subtle. A skin in &lt;code&gt;layouts/&lt;/code&gt; can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in &lt;code&gt;themes/&lt;/code&gt;, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the &lt;code&gt;themes/&lt;/code&gt; directory a theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the &lt;code&gt;layouts/&lt;/code&gt; directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-home-page&#34;&gt;The Home Page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;site-configuration-file&#34;&gt;Site Configuration File&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your &lt;code&gt;content/&lt;/code&gt; directory and template files in your &lt;code&gt;themes/&lt;/code&gt; directory. It will create HTML files in your &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;content&#34;&gt;Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;front-matter&#34;&gt;Front Matter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “&lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt;”, YAML by “&lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt;”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;template-files&#34;&gt;Template Files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it&amp;rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;single-template&#34;&gt;Single Template&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;list-template&#34;&gt;List Template&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;partial-template&#34;&gt;Partial Template&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-new-site&#34;&gt;Create a New Site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I&amp;rsquo;m a Mac user, so I&amp;rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you&amp;rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;new site&amp;rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a look in the content/ directory to confirm that it is empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme. That&amp;rsquo;s a topic for a different tutorial, so please ignore them for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generate-the-html-for-the-new-site&#34;&gt;Generate the HTML For the New Site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; command with no options will read all the available content and generate the HTML files. It will also copy all static files (that&amp;rsquo;s everything that&amp;rsquo;s not content). Since we have an empty site, it won&amp;rsquo;t do much, but it will do it very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;--verbose&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template. Every line of the output that starts with &amp;ldquo;INFO:&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;WARN:&amp;rdquo; is present because we used that flag. The lines that start with &amp;ldquo;WARN:&amp;rdquo; are warning messages. We&amp;rsquo;ll go over them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can verify that the command worked by looking at the directory again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;See that new public/ directory? Hugo placed all generated content there. When you&amp;rsquo;re ready to publish your web site, that&amp;rsquo;s the place to start. For now, though, let&amp;rsquo;s just confirm that we have what we&amp;rsquo;d expect from a site with no content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugo created two XML files, which is standard, but there are no HTML files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;test-the-new-site&#34;&gt;Test the New Site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify that you can run the built-in web server. It will dramatically shorten your development cycle if you do. Start it by running the &amp;ldquo;server&amp;rdquo; command. If it is successful, you will see output similar to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ hugo server --verbose

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connect to the listed URL (it&amp;rsquo;s on the line that starts with &amp;ldquo;Web Server&amp;rdquo;). If everything is working correctly, you should get a page that shows the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;index.xml
sitemap.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a listing of your public/ directory. Hugo didn&amp;rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content. When there&amp;rsquo;s no index.html file in a directory, the server lists the files in the directory, which is what you should see in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back and look at those warnings again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html]
WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That second warning is easier to explain. We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it&amp;rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we&amp;rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-new-theme&#34;&gt;Create a New Theme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo doesn&amp;rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to create a new theme called &amp;ldquo;zafta.&amp;rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo; over &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;create-a-skeleton&#34;&gt;Create a Skeleton&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the hugo &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme. This creates the directory structure and places empty files for you to fill out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1

They&amp;rsquo;re optional, but if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be distributing your theme, it tells the world who to praise (or blame). It&amp;rsquo;s also nice to declare the license so that people will know how they can use the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-the-configuration-file-to-use-the-theme&#34;&gt;Update the Configuration File to Use the Theme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve got a theme to work with, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to add the theme name to the configuration file. This is optional, because you can always add &amp;ldquo;-t zafta&amp;rdquo; on all your commands. I like to put it the configuration file because I like shorter command lines. If you don&amp;rsquo;t put it in the configuration file or specify it on the command line, you won&amp;rsquo;t use the template that you&amp;rsquo;re expecting to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit the file to add the theme, add a title for the site, and specify that all of our content will use the TOML format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have an empty theme, let&amp;rsquo;s generate the site again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you notice that the output is different? The warning message for the home page has disappeared and we have an additional information line saying that Hugo is syncing from the theme&amp;rsquo;s directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s check the public/ directory to see what Hugo&amp;rsquo;s created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ ls -l public

$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice four things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo created a home page. This is the file public/index.html.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo created a css/ directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo created a js/ directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo claimed that it created 0 pages. It created a file and copied over static files, but didn&amp;rsquo;t create any pages. That&amp;rsquo;s because it considers a &amp;ldquo;page&amp;rdquo; to be a file created directly from a content file. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-home-page-1&#34;&gt;The Home Page&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends. Hugo&amp;rsquo;s warning message shows that it looks for three different templates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it can&amp;rsquo;t find any of these, it completely skips creating the home page. We noticed that when we built the site without having a theme installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Hugo created our theme, it created an empty home page template. Now, when we build the site, Hugo finds the template and uses it to generate the HTML for the home page. Since the template file is empty, the HTML file is empty, too. If the template had any rules in it, then Hugo would have used them to generate the home page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ find . -name index.html | xargs ls -l

$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-magic-of-static&#34;&gt;The Magic of Static&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo does two things when generating the site. It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo&amp;rsquo;s opinion is that you&amp;rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or jane delete them completely. Hugo&amp;rsquo;s nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-theme-development-cycle&#34;&gt;The Theme Development Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re working on a theme, you will make changes in the theme&amp;rsquo;s directory, rebuild the site, and check your changes in the browser. Hugo makes this very easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purge the public/ directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the built in web server in watch mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your site in a browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glance at your browser window to see changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to step 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;purge-the-public-directory&#34;&gt;Purge the public/ Directory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If you&amp;rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hugos-watch-option&#34;&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Watch Option&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;--watch&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; option will monitor the content/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;live-reload&#34;&gt;Live Reload&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload. As pages are saved on the server, the browser is told to refresh the page. Usually, this happens faster than you can say, &amp;ldquo;Wow, that&amp;rsquo;s totally amazing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;development-commands&#34;&gt;Development Commands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the following commands as the basis for your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;## purge old files. hugo will recreate the public directory.
##
$ rm -rf public
##
## run hugo in watch mode
##
$ hugo server --watch --verbose
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s sample output showing Hugo detecting a change to the template for the home page. Once generated, the web browser automatically reloaded the page. I&amp;rsquo;ve said this before, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;23

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-the-home-page-template&#34;&gt;Update the Home Page Template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home page is one of a few special pages that Hugo creates automatically. As mentioned earlier, it looks for one of three files in the theme&amp;rsquo;s layout/ directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;index.html&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_default/list.html&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_default/single.html&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could update one of the default templates, but a good design decision is to update the most specific template available. That&amp;rsquo;s not a hard and fast rule (in fact, we&amp;rsquo;ll break it a few times in this tutorial), but it is a good generalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-a-static-home-page&#34;&gt;Make a Static Home Page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, that page is empty because we don&amp;rsquo;t have any content and we don&amp;rsquo;t have any logic in the template. Let&amp;rsquo;s change that by adding some text to the template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html

&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
:wq

$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build the web site and then verify the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;hugo says hello!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;document.write(&amp;#39;&amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;http://&amp;#39;
        + (location.host || &amp;#39;localhost&amp;#39;).split(&amp;#39;:&amp;#39;)[0]

&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you use &lt;code&gt;--watch&lt;/code&gt;, the Live Reload script is added by Hugo. Look for live reload in the documentation to see what it does and how to disable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;build-a-dynamic-home-page&#34;&gt;Build a &amp;ldquo;Dynamic&amp;rdquo; Home Page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dynamic home page?&amp;rdquo; Hugo&amp;rsquo;s a static web site generator, so this seems an odd thing to say. I mean let&amp;rsquo;s have the home page automatically reflect the content in the site every time Hugo builds it. We&amp;rsquo;ll use iteration in the template to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;create-new-posts&#34;&gt;Create New Posts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the home page generating static content, let&amp;rsquo;s add some content to the site. We&amp;rsquo;ll display these posts as a list on the home page and on their own page, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo has a command to generate a skeleton post, just like it does for sites and themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ hugo --verbose new post/first.md

$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn&amp;rsquo;t very nice, was it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; command uses an archetype to create the post file. Hugo created an empty default archetype file, but that causes an error when there&amp;rsquo;s a theme. For me, the workaround was to create an archetypes file specifically for the post type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new files are empty because because the templates used to generate the content are empty. The homepage doesn&amp;rsquo;t show the new content, either. We have to update the templates to add the posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;list-and-single-templates&#34;&gt;List and Single Templates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hugo, we have three major kinds of templates. There&amp;rsquo;s the home page template that we updated previously. It is used only by the home page. We also have &amp;ldquo;single&amp;rdquo; templates which are used to generate output for a single content file. We also have &amp;ldquo;list&amp;rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, list templates are named &amp;ldquo;list.html&amp;rdquo; and single templates are named &amp;ldquo;single.html.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-content-to-the-homepage&#34;&gt;Add Content to the Homepage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home page will contain a list of posts. Let&amp;rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created. The logic in the template will run every time we build the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
  {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }}
    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  {{ end }}
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
:wq

$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugo uses the Go template engine. That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between &amp;ldquo;{{&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;}}&amp;quot;. In our template, the commands are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;range&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.Title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;range&amp;rdquo; command is an iterator. We&amp;rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;.Title&amp;rdquo; command prints the value of the &amp;ldquo;title&amp;rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;end&amp;rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds &amp;ldquo;end.&amp;rdquo; Everything between the &amp;ldquo;range&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;end&amp;rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build the web site and then verify the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7

&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let&amp;rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we&amp;rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you&amp;rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that&amp;rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, though, that&amp;rsquo;s all to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-content-to-the-posts&#34;&gt;Add Content to the Posts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo; (and if we don&amp;rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can&amp;rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we&amp;rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know the search rule, let&amp;rsquo;s see what we actually have available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 quoha  staff  132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don&amp;rsquo;t know of any other content types, let&amp;rsquo;s start with updating the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, any content that we haven&amp;rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we&amp;rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we&amp;rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we&amp;rsquo;ve made. It&amp;rsquo;s good because we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It&amp;rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we&amp;rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we&amp;rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you&amp;rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That&amp;rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;create-a-post-listing&#34;&gt;Create a Post Listing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the posts displaying on the home page and on their own page. We also have a file public/post/index.html that is empty. Let&amp;rsquo;s make it show a list of all posts (not just the first ten).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to decide which template to update. This will be a listing, so it should be a list template. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look and see which list templates are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ find themes/zafta -name list.html | xargs ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 quoha  staff  0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/list.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the single post, we have to decide to update _default/list.html or create post/list.html. We still don&amp;rsquo;t have multiple content types, so let&amp;rsquo;s stay consistent and update the default list template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-top-level-pages&#34;&gt;Creating Top Level Pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s add an &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page and display it at the top level (as opposed to a sub-level like we did with posts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default in Hugo is to use the directory structure of the content/ directory to guide the location of the generated html in the public/ directory. Let&amp;rsquo;s verify that by creating an &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page at the top level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi content/about.md

:wq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate the web site and verify the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that the page wasn&amp;rsquo;t created at the top level. It was created in a sub-directory named &amp;lsquo;about-time/&#39;. That name came from our slug. Hugo will use the slug to name the generated content. It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable default, by the way, but we can learn a few things by fighting it for this file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing. Take a look at the home page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ cat public/index.html

&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that the &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; link is listed with the posts? That&amp;rsquo;s not desirable, so let&amp;rsquo;s change that first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;posts&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }}
    {{ if eq .Type &amp;#34;post&amp;#34;}}
      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .Permalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;pages&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  {{ range .Data.Pages }}

      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .Permalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

  {{ end }}
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
:wq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate the web site and verify the results. The home page has two sections, posts and pages, and each section has the right set of headings and links in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, that about page still renders to about-time/index.html.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ find public -name &amp;#39;*.html&amp;#39; | xargs ls -l

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that hugo is using the slug to generate the file name, the simplest solution is to change the slug. Let&amp;rsquo;s do it the hard way and change the permalink in the configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;

	page = &amp;#34;/:title/&amp;#34;
	about = &amp;#34;/:filename/&amp;#34;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate the web site and verify that this didn&amp;rsquo;t work. Hugo lets &amp;ldquo;slug&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;URL&amp;rdquo; override the permalinks setting in the configuration file. Go ahead and comment out the slug in content/about.md, then generate the web site to get it to be created in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sharing-templates&#34;&gt;Sharing Templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following along, you probably noticed that posts have titles in the browser and the home page doesn&amp;rsquo;t. That&amp;rsquo;s because we didn&amp;rsquo;t put the title in the home page&amp;rsquo;s template (layouts/index.html). That&amp;rsquo;s an easy thing to do, but let&amp;rsquo;s look at a different option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can put the common bits into a shared template that&amp;rsquo;s stored in the themes/zafta/layouts/partials/ directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;create-the-header-and-footer-partials&#34;&gt;Create the Header and Footer Partials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hugo, a partial is a sugar-coated template. Normally a template reference has a path specified. Partials are different. Hugo searches for them along a TODO defined search path. This makes it easier for end-users to override the theme&amp;rsquo;s presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
:wq

$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
:wq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-the-home-page-template-to-use-the-partials&#34;&gt;Update the Home Page Template to Use the Partials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most noticeable difference between a template call and a partials call is the lack of path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;{{ template &amp;#34;theme/partials/header.html&amp;#34; . }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;versus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;{{ partial &amp;#34;header.html&amp;#34; . }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both pass in the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s change the home page template to use these new partials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html
{{ partial &amp;#34;header.html&amp;#34; . }}

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;posts&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }}
    {{ if eq .Type &amp;#34;post&amp;#34;}}
      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .Permalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;pages&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  {{ range .Data.Pages }}
    {{ if or (eq .Type &amp;#34;page&amp;#34;) (eq .Type &amp;#34;about&amp;#34;) }}
      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .Permalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;{{ .Type }} - {{ .Title }} - {{ .RelPermalink }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}

{{ partial &amp;#34;footer.html&amp;#34; . }}
:wq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate the web site and verify the results. The title on the home page is now &amp;ldquo;your title here&amp;rdquo;, which comes from the &amp;ldquo;title&amp;rdquo; variable in the config.toml file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-the-default-single-template-to-use-the-partials&#34;&gt;Update the Default Single Template to Use the Partials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html
{{ partial &amp;#34;header.html&amp;#34; . }}

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  {{ .Content }}

{{ partial &amp;#34;footer.html&amp;#34; . }}
:wq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate the web site and verify the results. The title on the posts and the about page should both reflect the value in the markdown file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;add-date-published-to-posts&#34;&gt;Add “Date Published” to Posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s common to have posts display the date that they were written or published, so let&amp;rsquo;s add that. The front matter of our posts has a variable named &amp;ldquo;date.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s usually the date the content was created, but let&amp;rsquo;s pretend that&amp;rsquo;s the value we want to display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-date-published-to-the-template&#34;&gt;Add “Date Published” to the Template&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll start by updating the template used to render the posts. The template code will look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;{{ .Date.Format &amp;#34;Mon, Jan 2, 2006&amp;#34; }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posts use the default single template, so we&amp;rsquo;ll change that file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html
{{ partial &amp;#34;header.html&amp;#34; . }}

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;{{ .Date.Format &amp;#34;Mon, Jan 2, 2006&amp;#34; }}&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
  {{ .Content }}

{{ partial &amp;#34;footer.html&amp;#34; . }}
:wq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate the web site and verify the results. The posts now have the date displayed in them. There&amp;rsquo;s a problem, though. The &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page also has the date displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, there are a couple of ways to make the date display only on posts. We could do an &amp;ldquo;if&amp;rdquo; statement like we did on the home page. Another way would be to create a separate template for posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;if&amp;rdquo; solution works for sites that have just a couple of content types. It aligns with the principle of &amp;ldquo;code for today,&amp;rdquo; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume, though, that we&amp;rsquo;ve made our site so complex that we feel we have to create a new template type. In Hugo-speak, we&amp;rsquo;re going to create a section template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s restore the default single template before we forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ mkdir themes/zafta/layouts/post
$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html
{{ partial &amp;#34;header.html&amp;#34; . }}

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  {{ .Content }}

{{ partial &amp;#34;footer.html&amp;#34; . }}
:wq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;ll update the post&amp;rsquo;s version of the single template. If you remember Hugo&amp;rsquo;s rules, the template engine will use this version over the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/post/single.html
{{ partial &amp;#34;header.html&amp;#34; . }}

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;{{ .Date.Format &amp;#34;Mon, Jan 2, 2006&amp;#34; }}&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
  {{ .Content }}

{{ partial &amp;#34;footer.html&amp;#34; . }}
:wq

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that we removed the date logic from the default template and put it in the post template. Generate the web site and verify the results. Posts have dates and the about page doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-repeat-yourself&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRY is a good design goal and Hugo does a great job supporting it. Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you&amp;rsquo;re figuring that out, accept that you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing some refactoring. Hugo makes that easy and fast, so it&amp;rsquo;s okay to delay splitting up a template.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating a New Theme</title>
      <link>http://www.964813.xyz/post/creating-a-new-theme/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.964813.xyz/post/creating-a-new-theme/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the &amp;ldquo;$&amp;rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with &amp;ldquo;#&amp;rdquo; are comments that I&amp;rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the &amp;ldquo;:wq&amp;rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;23
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;## this is a comment

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-definitions&#34;&gt;Some Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;skins&#34;&gt;Skins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the &lt;code&gt;layouts/&lt;/code&gt; directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the &lt;code&gt;layouts/&lt;/code&gt; directory so it will always find the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the &lt;code&gt;themes/&lt;/code&gt; directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between creating a skin in &lt;code&gt;layouts/&lt;/code&gt; and creating it in &lt;code&gt;themes/&lt;/code&gt; is very subtle. A skin in &lt;code&gt;layouts/&lt;/code&gt; can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in &lt;code&gt;themes/&lt;/code&gt;, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the &lt;code&gt;themes/&lt;/code&gt; directory a theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the &lt;code&gt;layouts/&lt;/code&gt; directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-home-page&#34;&gt;The Home Page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;site-configuration-file&#34;&gt;Site Configuration File&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your &lt;code&gt;content/&lt;/code&gt; directory and template files in your &lt;code&gt;themes/&lt;/code&gt; directory. It will create HTML files in your &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;content&#34;&gt;Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;front-matter&#34;&gt;Front Matter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “&lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt;”, YAML by “&lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt;”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;template-files&#34;&gt;Template Files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it&amp;rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;single-template&#34;&gt;Single Template&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;list-template&#34;&gt;List Template&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;partial-template&#34;&gt;Partial Template&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-new-site&#34;&gt;Create a New Site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I&amp;rsquo;m a Mac user, so I&amp;rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you&amp;rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;new site&amp;rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ hugo new site ~/Sites/zafta

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a look in the content/ directory to confirm that it is empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme. That&amp;rsquo;s a topic for a different tutorial, so please ignore them for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generate-the-html-for-the-new-site&#34;&gt;Generate the HTML For the New Site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; command with no options will read all the available content and generate the HTML files. It will also copy all static files (that&amp;rsquo;s everything that&amp;rsquo;s not content). Since we have an empty site, it won&amp;rsquo;t do much, but it will do it very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;--verbose&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template. Every line of the output that starts with &amp;ldquo;INFO:&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;WARN:&amp;rdquo; is present because we used that flag. The lines that start with &amp;ldquo;WARN:&amp;rdquo; are warning messages. We&amp;rsquo;ll go over them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can verify that the command worked by looking at the directory again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;See that new public/ directory? Hugo placed all generated content there. When you&amp;rsquo;re ready to publish your web site, that&amp;rsquo;s the place to start. For now, though, let&amp;rsquo;s just confirm that we have what we&amp;rsquo;d expect from a site with no content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugo created two XML files, which is standard, but there are no HTML files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;test-the-new-site&#34;&gt;Test the New Site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify that you can run the built-in web server. It will dramatically shorten your development cycle if you do. Start it by running the &amp;ldquo;server&amp;rdquo; command. If it is successful, you will see output similar to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connect to the listed URL (it&amp;rsquo;s on the line that starts with &amp;ldquo;Web Server&amp;rdquo;). If everything is working correctly, you should get a page that shows the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a listing of your public/ directory. Hugo didn&amp;rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content. When there&amp;rsquo;s no index.html file in a directory, the server lists the files in the directory, which is what you should see in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back and look at those warnings again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html]
WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That second warning is easier to explain. We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it&amp;rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we&amp;rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-new-theme&#34;&gt;Create a New Theme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo doesn&amp;rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to create a new theme called &amp;ldquo;zafta.&amp;rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo; over &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;create-a-skeleton&#34;&gt;Create a Skeleton&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the hugo &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme. This creates the directory structure and places empty files for you to fill out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please take a minute to fill out the theme.toml and LICENSE.md files. They&amp;rsquo;re optional, but if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be distributing your theme, it tells the world who to praise (or blame). It&amp;rsquo;s also nice to declare the license so that people will know how they can use the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve got a theme to work with, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to add the theme name to the configuration file. This is optional, because you can always add &amp;ldquo;-t zafta&amp;rdquo; on all your commands. I like to put it the configuration file because I like shorter command lines. If you don&amp;rsquo;t put it in the configuration file or specify it on the command line, you won&amp;rsquo;t use the template that you&amp;rsquo;re expecting to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit the file to add the theme, add a title for the site, and specify that all of our content will use the TOML format.&lt;/p&gt;

$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice four things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo created a home page. This is the file public/index.html.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo created a css/ directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo created a js/ directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo claimed that it created 0 pages. It created a file and copied over static files, but didn&amp;rsquo;t create any pages. That&amp;rsquo;s because it considers a &amp;ldquo;page&amp;rdquo; to be a file created directly from a content file. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-home-page-1&#34;&gt;The Home Page&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends. Hugo&amp;rsquo;s warning message shows that it looks for three different templates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it can&amp;rsquo;t find any of these, it completely skips creating the home page. We noticed that when we built the site without having a theme installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Hugo created our theme, it created an empty home page template. Now, when we build the site, Hugo finds the template and uses it to generate the HTML for the home page. Since the template file is empty, the HTML file is empty, too. If the template had any rules in it, then Hugo would have used them to generate the home page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-magic-of-static&#34;&gt;The Magic of Static&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo does two things when generating the site. It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo&amp;rsquo;s opinion is that you&amp;rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely. Hugo&amp;rsquo;s nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-theme-development-cycle&#34;&gt;The Theme Development Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re working on a theme, you will make changes in the theme&amp;rsquo;s directory, rebuild the site, and check your changes in the browser. Hugo makes this very easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purge the public/ directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the built in web server in watch mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your site in a browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glance at your browser window to see changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to step 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;purge-the-public-directory&#34;&gt;Purge the public/ Directory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If you&amp;rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hugos-watch-option&#34;&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Watch Option&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;--watch&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo; option will monitor the content/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;live-reload&#34;&gt;Live Reload&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload. As pages are saved on the server, the browser is told to refresh the page. Usually, this happens faster than you can say, &amp;ldquo;Wow, that&amp;rsquo;s totally amazing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;development-commands&#34;&gt;Development Commands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the following commands as the basis for your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;## purge old files. hugo will recreate the public directory.
##
$ rm -rf public
##
## run hugo in watch mode
##
$ hugo server --watch --verbose
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s sample output showing Hugo detecting a change to the template for the home page. Once generated, the web browser automatically reloaded the page. I&amp;rsquo;ve said this before, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;23
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;24
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;25
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;26
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-the-home-page-template&#34;&gt;Update the Home Page Template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home page is one of a few special pages that Hugo creates automatically. As mentioned earlier, it looks for one of three files in the theme&amp;rsquo;s layout/ directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;index.html&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_default/list.html&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_default/single.html&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could update one of the default templates, but a good design decision is to update the most specific template available. That&amp;rsquo;s not a hard and fast rule (in fact, we&amp;rsquo;ll break it a few times in this tutorial), but it is a good generalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-a-static-home-page&#34;&gt;Make a Static Home Page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, that page is empty because we don&amp;rsquo;t have any content and we don&amp;rsquo;t have any logic in the template. Let&amp;rsquo;s change that by adding some text to the template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html

&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
:wq

$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build the web site and then verify the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;hugo says hello!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you use &lt;code&gt;--watch&lt;/code&gt;, the Live Reload script is added by Hugo. Look for live reload in the documentation to see what it does and how to disable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;build-a-dynamic-home-page&#34;&gt;Build a &amp;ldquo;Dynamic&amp;rdquo; Home Page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dynamic home page?&amp;rdquo; Hugo&amp;rsquo;s a static web site generator, so this seems an odd thing to say. I mean let&amp;rsquo;s have the home page automatically reflect the content in the site every time Hugo builds it. We&amp;rsquo;ll use iteration in the template to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;create-new-posts&#34;&gt;Create New Posts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the home page generating static content, let&amp;rsquo;s add some content to the site. We&amp;rsquo;ll display these posts as a list on the home page and on their own page, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo has a command to generate a skeleton post, just like it does for sites and themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ hugo --verbose new post/first.md

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn&amp;rsquo;t very nice, was it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; command uses an archetype to create the post file. Hugo created an empty default archetype file, but that causes an error when there&amp;rsquo;s a theme. For me, the workaround was to create an archetypes file specifically for the post type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new files are empty because because the templates used to generate the content are empty. The homepage doesn&amp;rsquo;t show the new content, either. We have to update the templates to add the posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;list-and-single-templates&#34;&gt;List and Single Templates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hugo, we have three major kinds of templates. There&amp;rsquo;s the home page template that we updated previously. It is used only by the home page. We also have &amp;ldquo;single&amp;rdquo; templates which are used to generate output for a single content file. We also have &amp;ldquo;list&amp;rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, list templates are named &amp;ldquo;list.html&amp;rdquo; and single templates are named &amp;ldquo;single.html.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-content-to-the-homepage&#34;&gt;Add Content to the Homepage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home page will contain a list of posts. Let&amp;rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created. The logic in the template will run every time we build the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
  {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }}
    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  {{ end }}
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
:wq

$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugo uses the Go template engine. That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between &amp;ldquo;{{&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;}}&amp;quot;. In our template, the commands are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;range&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.Title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;range&amp;rdquo; command is an iterator. We&amp;rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;.Title&amp;rdquo; command prints the value of the &amp;ldquo;title&amp;rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;end&amp;rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds &amp;ldquo;end.&amp;rdquo; Everything between the &amp;ldquo;range&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;end&amp;rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build the web site and then verify the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4

    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;second&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let&amp;rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we&amp;rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you&amp;rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that&amp;rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, though, that&amp;rsquo;s all to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-content-to-the-posts&#34;&gt;Add Content to the Posts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo; (and if we don&amp;rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can&amp;rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we&amp;rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know the search rule, let&amp;rsquo;s see what we actually have available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 quoha  staff  132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don&amp;rsquo;t know of any other content types, let&amp;rsquo;s start with updating the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, any content that we haven&amp;rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we&amp;rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we&amp;rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we&amp;rsquo;ve made. It&amp;rsquo;s good because we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It&amp;rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we&amp;rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we&amp;rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you&amp;rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That&amp;rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;create-a-post-listing&#34;&gt;Create a Post Listing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the posts displaying on the home page and on their own page. We also have a file public/post/index.html that is empty. Let&amp;rsquo;s make it show a list of all posts (not just the first ten).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to decide which template to update. This will be a listing, so it should be a list template. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look and see which list templates are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ find themes/zafta -name list.html | xargs ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 quoha  staff  0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/list.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the single post, we have to decide to update _default/list.html or create post/list.html. We still don&amp;rsquo;t have multiple content types, so let&amp;rsquo;s stay consistent and update the default list template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-top-level-pages&#34;&gt;Creating Top Level Pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s add an &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page and display it at the top level (as opposed to a sub-level like we did with posts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default in Hugo is to use the directory structure of the content/ directory to guide the location of the generated html in the public/ directory. Let&amp;rsquo;s verify that by creating an &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page at the top level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that the page wasn&amp;rsquo;t created at the top level. It was created in a sub-directory named &amp;lsquo;about-time/&#39;. That name came from our slug. Hugo will use the slug to name the generated content. It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable default, by the way, but we can learn a few things by fighting it for this file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing. Take a look at the home page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ cat public/index.html
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;http://localhost:1313/post/theme/&amp;#34;&amp;gt;creating a new theme&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;http://localhost:1313/about-time/&amp;#34;&amp;gt;about&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;http://localhost:1313/post/first-post/&amp;#34;&amp;gt;first&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;document.write(&amp;#39;&amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;http://&amp;#39;
        + (location.host || &amp;#39;localhost&amp;#39;).split(&amp;#39;:&amp;#39;)[0]
		+ &amp;#39;:1313/livereload.js?mindelay=10&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;#39;
        + &amp;#39;script&amp;gt;&amp;#39;)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that the &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; link is listed with the posts? That&amp;rsquo;s not desirable, so let&amp;rsquo;s change that first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;posts&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }}
    {{ if eq .Type &amp;#34;post&amp;#34;}}
      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .Permalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;pages&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  {{ range .Data.Pages }}
    {{ if eq .Type &amp;#34;page&amp;#34; }}
      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .Permalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
:wq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate the web site and verify the results. The home page has two sections, posts and pages, and each section has the right set of headings and links in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, that about page still renders to about-time/index.html.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ find public -name &amp;#39;*.html&amp;#39; | xargs ls -l

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that hugo is using the slug to generate the file name, the simplest solution is to change the slug. Let&amp;rsquo;s do it the hard way and change the permalink in the configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi config.toml
[permalinks]
	page = &amp;#34;/:title/&amp;#34;
	about = &amp;#34;/:filename/&amp;#34;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate the web site and verify that this didn&amp;rsquo;t work. Hugo lets &amp;ldquo;slug&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;URL&amp;rdquo; override the permalinks setting in the configuration file. Go ahead and comment out the slug in content/about.md, then generate the web site to get it to be created in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sharing-templates&#34;&gt;Sharing Templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following along, you probably noticed that posts have titles in the browser and the home page doesn&amp;rsquo;t. That&amp;rsquo;s because we didn&amp;rsquo;t put the title in the home page&amp;rsquo;s template (layouts/index.html). That&amp;rsquo;s an easy thing to do, but let&amp;rsquo;s look at a different option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can put the common bits into a shared template that&amp;rsquo;s stored in the themes/zafta/layouts/partials/ directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;create-the-header-and-footer-partials&#34;&gt;Create the Header and Footer Partials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hugo, a partial is a sugar-coated template. Normally a template reference has a path specified. Partials are different. Hugo searches for them along a TODO defined search path. This makes it easier for end-users to override the theme&amp;rsquo;s presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
:wq

$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
:wq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-the-home-page-template-to-use-the-partials&#34;&gt;Update the Home Page Template to Use the Partials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most noticeable difference between a template call and a partials call is the lack of path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;{{ template &amp;#34;theme/partials/header.html&amp;#34; . }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;versus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;{{ partial &amp;#34;header.html&amp;#34; . }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both pass in the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s change the home page template to use these new partials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html
{{ partial &amp;#34;header.html&amp;#34; . }}

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;posts&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }}
    {{ if eq .Type &amp;#34;post&amp;#34;}}
      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .Permalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;pages&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  {{ range .Data.Pages }}
    {{ if or (eq .Type &amp;#34;page&amp;#34;) (eq .Type &amp;#34;about&amp;#34;) }}
      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .Permalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;{{ .Type }} - {{ .Title }} - {{ .RelPermalink }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}

{{ partial &amp;#34;footer.html&amp;#34; . }}
:wq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate the web site and verify the results. The title on the home page is now &amp;ldquo;your title here&amp;rdquo;, which comes from the &amp;ldquo;title&amp;rdquo; variable in the config.toml file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-the-default-single-template-to-use-the-partials&#34;&gt;Update the Default Single Template to Use the Partials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html
{{ partial &amp;#34;header.html&amp;#34; . }}

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  {{ .Content }}

{{ partial &amp;#34;footer.html&amp;#34; . }}
:wq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate the web site and verify the results. The title on the posts and the about page should both reflect the value in the markdown file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;add-date-published-to-posts&#34;&gt;Add “Date Published” to Posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s common to have posts display the date that they were written or published, so let&amp;rsquo;s add that. The front matter of our posts has a variable named &amp;ldquo;date.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s usually the date the content was created, but let&amp;rsquo;s pretend that&amp;rsquo;s the value we want to display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-date-published-to-the-template&#34;&gt;Add “Date Published” to the Template&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll start by updating the template used to render the posts. The template code will look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;{{ .Date.Format &amp;#34;Mon, Jan 2, 2006&amp;#34; }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posts use the default single template, so we&amp;rsquo;ll change that file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html
{{ partial &amp;#34;header.html&amp;#34; . }}

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;{{ .Date.Format &amp;#34;Mon, Jan 2, 2006&amp;#34; }}&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
  {{ .Content }}

{{ partial &amp;#34;footer.html&amp;#34; . }}
:wq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate the web site and verify the results. The posts now have the date displayed in them. There&amp;rsquo;s a problem, though. The &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page also has the date displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, there are a couple of ways to make the date display only on posts. We could do an &amp;ldquo;if&amp;rdquo; statement like we did on the home page. Another way would be to create a separate template for posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;if&amp;rdquo; solution works for sites that have just a couple of content types. It aligns with the principle of &amp;ldquo;code for today,&amp;rdquo; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume, though, that we&amp;rsquo;ve made our site so complex that we feel we have to create a new template type. In Hugo-speak, we&amp;rsquo;re going to create a section template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s restore the default single template before we forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ mkdir themes/zafta/layouts/post
$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html
{{ partial &amp;#34;header.html&amp;#34; . }}

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  {{ .Content }}

{{ partial &amp;#34;footer.html&amp;#34; . }}
:wq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;ll update the post&amp;rsquo;s version of the single template. If you remember Hugo&amp;rsquo;s rules, the template engine will use this version over the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/post/single.html
{{ partial &amp;#34;header.html&amp;#34; . }}

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;{{ .Date.Format &amp;#34;Mon, Jan 2, 2006&amp;#34; }}&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
  {{ .Content }}

{{ partial &amp;#34;footer.html&amp;#34; . }}
:wq

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that we removed the date logic from the default template and put it in the post template. Generate the web site and verify the results. Posts have dates and the about page doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-repeat-yourself&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRY is a good design goal and Hugo does a great job supporting it. Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you&amp;rsquo;re figuring that out, accept that you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing some refactoring. Hugo makes that easy and fast, so it&amp;rsquo;s okay to delay splitting up a template.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title>
      <link>http://www.964813.xyz/post/goisforlovers/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.964813.xyz/post/goisforlovers/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hugo uses the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://golang.org/&#34;&gt;go&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://golang.org/pkg/html/template/&#34;&gt;/post/will&lt;/a&gt; library for
its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very
small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of
logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other
template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of
similarities in go templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document is a brief primer on using go templates. The [go docs][/post/will]
provide more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-go-templates&#34;&gt;Introduction to Go Templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the
belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer.
One consequence of this simplicity is that go templates parse very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unique characteristic of go templates is they are content aware. Variables and
content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More
details can be found in the [go docs][/post/will].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-syntax&#34;&gt;Basic Syntax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go lang templates are html files with the addition of variables and
functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessing a predefined variable &amp;ldquo;foo&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ foo }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parameters are separated using spaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling the add function with input of 1, 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ add 1 2 }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessing the Page Parameter &amp;ldquo;bar&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ .Params.bar }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parentheses can be used to group items together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ if or (isset .Params &amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;) (isset .Params &amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;) }} Caption {{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;variables&#34;&gt;Variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each
template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of
page you are rendering. More details are available on the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/post/will&#34;&gt;variables&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;{{ .Title }}&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variables can also be defined and referenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ $address := &amp;quot;123 Main St.&amp;quot;}}
{{ $address }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;functions&#34;&gt;Functions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The go
template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the
available functions with their own. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/post/will&#34;&gt;Hugo template
functions&lt;/a&gt; provide some additional functionality we believe
are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name
followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template
functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ add 1 2 }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;includes&#34;&gt;Includes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be
able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to
include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at
the /layout/ directory within Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ template &amp;quot;chrome/header.html&amp;quot; . }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;logic&#34;&gt;Logic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iteration&#34;&gt;Iteration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like in go, the go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over
a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use
range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1: Using Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ range array }}
    {{ . }}
{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2: Declaring value variable name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{range $element := array}}
    {{ $element }}
{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{range $index, $element := array}}
    {{ $index }}
    {{ $element }}
{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conditionals&#34;&gt;Conditionals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, else, with, or, &amp;amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional
logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Templates treat the following values as false:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;false&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any array, slice, map, or string of length zero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1: If&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ if isset .Params &amp;quot;title&amp;quot; }}&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;{{ index .Params &amp;quot;title&amp;quot; }}&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2: If -&amp;gt; Else&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ if isset .Params &amp;quot;alt&amp;quot; }}
    {{ index .Params &amp;quot;alt&amp;quot; }}
{{else}}
    {{ index .Params &amp;quot;caption&amp;quot; }}
{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 3: And &amp;amp; Or&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ if and (or (isset .Params &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;) (isset .Params &amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;)) (isset .Params &amp;quot;attr&amp;quot;)}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 4: With&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative way of writing &amp;ldquo;if&amp;rdquo; and then referencing the same value
is to use &amp;ldquo;with&amp;rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; within its scope,
and skips the block if the variable is absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first example above could be simplified as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ with .Params.title }}&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;{{ . }}&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 5: If -&amp;gt; Else If&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ if isset .Params &amp;quot;alt&amp;quot; }}
    {{ index .Params &amp;quot;alt&amp;quot; }}
{{ else if isset .Params &amp;quot;caption&amp;quot; }}
    {{ index .Params &amp;quot;caption&amp;quot; }}
{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pipes&#34;&gt;Pipes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful components of go templates is the ability to
stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed
from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline&amp;rsquo;s output becomes the
input of the following pipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the very simple syntax of go templates, the pipe is essential
to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the
pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value
becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1 :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is the same as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good
illustration of how to use the pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2 :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ index .Params &amp;quot;disqus_url&amp;quot; | html }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access the page parameter called &amp;ldquo;disqus_url&amp;rdquo; and escape the HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 3 :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ if or (or (isset .Params &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;) (isset .Params &amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;)) (isset .Params &amp;quot;attr&amp;quot;)}}
Stuff Here
{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could be rewritten as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{  isset .Params &amp;quot;caption&amp;quot; | or isset .Params &amp;quot;title&amp;quot; | or isset .Params &amp;quot;attr&amp;quot; | if }}
Stuff Here
{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;context-aka-the-dot&#34;&gt;Context (aka. the dot)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most easily overlooked concept to understand about go templates is that {{ . }}
always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this
will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have
the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. .
will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to
access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable
instead of depending on the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  {{ $title := .Site.Title }}
  {{ range .Params.tags }}
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{ . }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; - {{ $title }} &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  {{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We
have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within
the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;hugo-parameters&#34;&gt;Hugo Parameters&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language
through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta
data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any
type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however
you want to inside of your templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-content-page-parameters&#34;&gt;Using Content (page) Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the
templates. This happens in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.964813.xyz/post/will&#34;&gt;front matter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages
benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just
doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We&amp;rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter
of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the example front matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;---
title: &amp;#34;Permalinks&amp;#34;
date: &amp;#34;2013-11-18&amp;#34;
aliases:
  - &amp;#34;/doc/permalinks/&amp;#34;
groups: [&amp;#34;extras&amp;#34;]
groups_weight: 30
notoc: true
---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  {{ if not .Params.notoc }}
    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;toc&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    {{ .TableOfContents }}
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  {{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-site-config-parameters&#34;&gt;Using Site (config) Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your top-level configuration file (eg, &lt;code&gt;config.yaml&lt;/code&gt;) you can define site
parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, you might declare:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;params&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;CopyrightHTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Copyright &amp;amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;TwitterUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;spf13&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;SidebarRecentLimit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a footer layout, you might then declare a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is only
provided if the &lt;code&gt;CopyrightHTML&lt;/code&gt; parameter is provided, and if it is given,
you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped
again.  This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each
January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;text-center&amp;#34;&amp;gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;{{end}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative way of writing the &amp;ldquo;if&amp;rdquo; and then referencing the same value
is to use &amp;ldquo;with&amp;rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; within its scope,
and skips the block if the variable is absent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}&amp;lt;span class=&amp;#34;twitter&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://twitter.com/{{.}}&amp;#34; rel=&amp;#34;author&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;/images/twitter.png&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;48&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;48&amp;#34; title=&amp;#34;Twitter: {{.}}&amp;#34;
 alt=&amp;#34;Twitter&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;{{end}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you want to pull &amp;ldquo;magic constants&amp;rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do
so, such as in this example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;nav class=&amp;#34;recent&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Recent Posts&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}}
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{.RelPermalink}}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;{{.Title}}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  {{end}}&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
